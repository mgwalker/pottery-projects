- name: lamp thing maybe?

    I'm kinda thinking a big vertical tube with room in the bottom to coil a
    rope light, and then holes carved into the tube to let let out. I would
    like to have a "floating" component as well.
- name: hinge

    A functional hinge made of clay! I think it should work, and it would open
    up some really interesting possiblities for future builds.
- name: teapot

    I'd like to be able to heat up a bunch of water, brew a bunch of tea, and
    then pour cups out of it while it stays hot in the teapot. And why not try
    to make it myself?
