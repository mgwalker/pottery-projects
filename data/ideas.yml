    I'm kinda thinking a big vertical tube with room in the bottom to coil a
    rope light, and then holes carved into the tube to let let out. I would
    like to have a "floating" component as well.
- name: hinge

    A functional hinge made of clay! I think it should work, and it would open
    up some really interesting possiblities for future builds.

    I'd like to be able to heat up a bunch of water, brew a bunch of tea, and
    then pour cups out of it while it stays hot in the teapot. And why not try
    to make it myself?
- name: flour scoop 2

    My husband has said he'd like another one for the other flour container.
    Okay then! I know how to do this one.

    I've been putting off trying to build any cups that I would actually try
    to use until I learned to throw on the wheel, but since that's likely to
    be a while... maybe it's time to hand-build one.
