projects:
  - name: measuring scoop
    description: |
      Take two of the 1/2-cup measuring cup. I've got the math right this time
      so... we'll see!
  - name: lamp thing maybe?
    description: |
      I'm kinda thinking a big horizontal tube with room in the bottom to coil a
      rope light, and then holes carved into the tube to let light out. I would
      like to have a "floating" component as well.
  - name: dog food bowl
    step: glazed
    description: |
      A food bowl for my dog. Pretty simple hand-build with a paw print scraped
      into the center of the bowl. For glazing, I used "very white" for the
      inside and a black to fill in paw print. On the outside, I used "reitz
      blue" as a base, with streaks of "very white" (white), shaner red
      (hopefully turns brown at firing), and "iron saturate" (hopefully fires
      black) to maybe look like dog hair.
  - name: coffee canister
    step: cleaned
    description: |
      A canister for holding coffee. It has sculpted coffee beans stuck to the
      front, and a lid that fits into a lip on the top. This one is in the kiln
      now and hopefully it won't explode or crack, but I'm not super optimistic
      that the lid is going to survive unscathed.
  - name: flour scoop
    step: done
    description: |
      Just a flour scoop. It has the word "flour" carved in cursive into the
      bottom of it. I don't remember what glaze I used, except that I was going
      for something kinda orange. It turned out brown.
  - name: accidental shot glass
    step: done
    description: |
      This was supposed to be a 1/2-cup measuring cup for my dog's food. When I
      did my math, I used the radius when I meant to use the diameter, so it's
      only about a quarter the size it's supposed to be. Conveniently, it's
      just about right for a shot glass, so whatever! Glaze is all white.
  - name: soap dish
    step: cleaned
  - name: lidded box
    step: cleaned
  - name: cup with handle
    step: cleaned
  - name: planter
    step: cleaned
    description: |
      The soap dish, lidded box, cup with handle, and planter are all part of a
      hand-building class I took at home. They are with the studio to be glazed
      and fired, and I don't really know anything more about their status than
      that. They'll email me when they're ready to pick up.
