A canister for holding coffee. This one is hand-built using slabs. I added the
lid and lip a week or so after building the canister, which I wouldn't do again
even though it worked out well this time. (I had meant to build the canister
taller and then slice the lid off the body, but... I forgot.) The coffee beans
were sculpted individually and then attached. The engraved text was marked out
with a stamp, but I had to then carve them out by hand because the clay was
already pretty hard by that time.

I had intended for the body to be solid white, but this kind of speckled look is
neat. I brushed the glaze on the exterior because the alternative was dipping it
and I was worried I wouldn't be able to get all of the white off the beans.
There are three brushed-on layers, but I guess that was still too thin. Oh well,
no complaints from me!

I am especially happy with how the beans turned out. I was really hoping for a
sort of matte brown (or at least less glossy than typical glaze), and it came
out just right! They have two brushed-on coats of a red glaze (more info below)
and this brown outcome is so good. I also brushed in a single coat of a little
bit of black around the grooves. It seems to have worked out well!
