This was supposed to be a 1/2-cup measuring cup for my dog's food. When I did my
math, I used the radius when I meant to use the diameter, so it's only about a
quarter the size it's supposed to be. Conveniently, it's just about right for a
shot glass, so whatever!

The glaze is all white. I put it on a little too thick so it cracked and fell
off around the top lip, but it's vitrified so it's still functional.
