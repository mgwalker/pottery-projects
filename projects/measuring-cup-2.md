Take two of the [1/2-cup measuring
cup]({% project "/projects/measuring-cup" %}). Instead of carving a paw print on
the inside, this time I decided to carve `1/2` into it instead. And after
bisquing, it holds precisely 1/2 cup!

It's glazed in glossy white, with the engraving brushed-in with St. John's
Black.
