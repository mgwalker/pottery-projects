Take two of the [1/2-cup measuring
cup]({% project "/projects/measuring-cup" %}). Instead of carving a paw print on
the inside, this time I decided to carve `1/2` into it instead. And after
bisquing, it holds precisely 1/2 cup!

It's glazed in glossy white, with the engraving brushed-in with St. John's
Black.

The white came out unexpectedly thin _again_ and broke over every tiny,
imperceptible bump in the surface. And the black inside the cup turned blue. I
guess St. John's Black over a white glaze just turns blue, like happened with
the [dog food bowl]({% project "/projects/dog-food-bowl" %}).

It also holds very nearly exactly 1/2 cup. Liquid. It doesn't work for its
intended purpose of measuring dog food, though, because it's too narrow and the
kibble can't lay flat and spread enough. As a result, the cup only holds about
1/4 cup of kibble.
