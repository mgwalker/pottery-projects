This was one of the projects for an at-home hand-building class I took. This was
the third of four projects, and by this point I was feeling confident enough to
put a little bit of my own spin on things. The project instructions were to add
a small ball for a handle on the lid, but I decided to build a ribbon and do
that as a handle instead. It turned out to be a little harder than I thought,
but it was good exercise in bending and flexing clay.

After I built these class projects, I took them back to the studio to be glazed
and fired. I got to pick the glaze color, but they did all the actual work. And
then I got to see the final product!
