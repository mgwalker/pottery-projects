This was one of the projects for an at-home hand-building class I took. It was
another slab build, and I deviated FAR from the instructions on this one. The
project brief was for a traditional soapdish, but I decided to do something
different. Instead, I made this kind of curly thing that was intended to hold
the soap upright.

After I built these class projects, I took them back to the studio to be glazed
and fired. I got to pick the glaze color, but they did all the actual work. And
then I got to see the final product!
