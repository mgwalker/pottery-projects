I went into the studio a few days after Christmas in kind of a bad mood. I'd had
restless sleep and just wanted to be somewhere quiet and alone for a while.
There were a couple of project ideas floating in my head, but nothing I was
ready to start working on, so I wasn't sure what I was going to do.

I started with a circle, because why not, and then I had the thought of making a
pinwheel. I thought about the pinwheel in my mother in law's front yard, and
thought something with petals might be interesting. And so... I built. Once I
had a bunch of petals, I arranged them together to see how it looked.

This build is still in progress, because I still don't know what to do with it.
But this much is here, and it's big.
