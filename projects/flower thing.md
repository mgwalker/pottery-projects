I went into the studio a few days after Christmas in kind of a bad mood. I'd had
restless sleep and just wanted to be somewhere quiet and alone for a while.
There were a couple of project ideas floating in my head, but nothing I was
ready to start working on, so I wasn't sure what I was going to do.

I started with a circle, because why not, and then I had the thought of making a
pinwheel. I thought about the pinwheel in my mother in law's front yard, and
thought something with petals might be interesting. And so... I built. Once I
had a bunch of petals, I arranged them together to see how it looked.

This build is still in progress, because I still don't know what to do with it.
But this much is here, and it's big.

One of the petals broke when I was trying to move the piece onto a table, but I
was able to fix it with a bit of slip. After letting it sit overnight to dry
some more, everything was well attached. Then I picked it up to get ready to
take it back to the studio and three petals broke. Welp.

So I broke the whole thing up and put all the clay in a bag with water to
rehydrate it so I can use it for another project. Ah well! Sometimes it doesn't
work out. On the plus side, all of the breaks were in the middle of the clay
pieces, not at the joins! All of my joins survived, even the patch job to repair
the first petal that broke!
