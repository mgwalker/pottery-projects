This was one of the projects for an at-home hand-building class I took. The
first project, the <a href="{% project "/projects/planter" %}">planter</a>, was
coiled, and this cup was my first attempt at slab building. It turned out I
enjoyed slab building much more than coiling, and attaching a handle was a very
important learning experience.

On this one, after it had dried a little bit and I was working on cleaning it
up, I decided to exercise a little creativity and added some circles to the body
and some scratch decoration between them. After I built these class projects, I
took them back to the studio to be glazed and fired. I got to pick the glaze
color, but they did all the actual work. And then I got to see the final
product!

I really like the kind of denim effect of the glaze. The cup turned out a little
small for my use (maybe around 8 ounces, so pretty good for a tea or coffee
cup), but I am really pleased with how well the handle is attached.
