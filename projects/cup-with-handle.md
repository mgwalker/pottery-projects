This was one of the projects for an at-home hand-building class I took. The
first project, the <a href="{% project "/projects/planter" %}">planter</a>, was
coiled, and this cup was my first attempt at slab building.

After I built these class projects, I took them back to the studio to be glazed
and fired. I got to pick the glaze color, but they did all the actual work.
Anyway, I picked them up and I liked how they turned out. Not a very functional
cup (a bit small, and the lip is uncomfortable), but cute. I like how the glaze
has kind of a denim effect, too.
