My husband wanted a second <a href="{% project "/projects/flour-scoop" %}">flour
scoop</a> to replace the table spoon he kept in the _other_ flour container.
So... here we go. Learning from the outcomes of the first one, I set out to make
the wall go further down the body on this one while still coming to a nice
point. I also added a small bar at the top of the inside handle as something you
could use for leverage when scooping.

The clay was wetter than I thought it was when I started this build. I started
by cutting out the base and then cutting a slab that would go about 70% of the
way around that circle. The slab would be attached to form the wall. But because
the wall was not complete and didn't support itself and the clay was wet, the
walls really wanted to collapse. I propped the walls up between a couple of
things I had handy and let it sit for a bit, and that seemed to have done the
trick.

During the cleaning and trimming phase, I opted to engrave some text again. On
the previous flour scoop, I engraved the word "flour" in cursive on the base.
This time I decided to be even more utilitarian and generic.
