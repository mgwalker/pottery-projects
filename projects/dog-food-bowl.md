title: Dog food bowl

A food bowl for my dog. Pretty simple hand-build with a paw print scraped into
the center of the bowl. For glazing, I used "very white" for the inside and a
black to fill in paw print. On the outside, I used "reitz blue" as a base, with
streaks of "very white" (white), shaner red (hopefully turns brown at firing),
and "iron saturate" (hopefully fires black) to maybe look like dog hair.

**Lesson learned!** Don't sponge on glaze. It doesn't go on _nearly_ thick
enough that way.

### Glazing

| exterior decoration | very white, shaner red, iron saturate | White, brown, and black, respectively. Meant to emulate strokes of dog fur. We'll see what happens! | Washed out entirely |

The glazing turned out pretty poorly. In an effort to have more control over the
thickness of the glaze, I decided to try patting it on with a sponge. That
resulted in too little glaze and several large spots inside the bowl that do not
appear to be glazed at all. However, since it was fired to cone 10, the ceramic
is vitrified, so this bowl is still food-safe, and frankly I kind of like the
way it looks!
