After my <a href="{% project "/projects/cup-with-handle" %}">cup-with-handle</a>
project from the at-home class produced a nice cup that's just much smaller than
I'd want to use regularly, I've decided to have a go at building one closer to
the size I want. I build and used a <a href="{% project "/volume" %}">tool to
calculate sizes to achieve a given volume</a>. My goal is a 16 ounce mug.

My base circle was essentially perfect. Then I measured out the walls and that
went well, except the walls were a bit too big. Hmm! And that's when I realized
I had booched the measurements again. I'd cut my base circle to the right radius
for the _interior_ of the mug and had forgotten to account for the thickness of
the walls that would need to sit on top of the base. UGH!

I also had a bit of trouble with the handle. I think the clay had dried a bit
(it was a bit that I had trimmed away from the slab to cut out the walls) and it
stressed a lot when I tried to bend it into shape. I think in the future, I need
to be more attentive to the clay is responding when I try to bend it, and maybe
give it a bit of water to help it relax.

In addition to cleaning the mug, which went pretty well since the handle
survived really well, I carved my signature stylized giraffe in relief into the
two sides of the mug. Depending on how it turns out, this could become my
favorite mug ever.
