My husband wanted a flour scoop to replace the table spoon he kept in the flour
container. So... I set out to hand-build one. This was my first on-my-own
project, and it was a lot of fun trying to understand how to shape the clay to
get the right final outcome.

After it dried a bit, I cleaned it all up and carved the word "flour" in cursive
into the bottom of the scoop. Then I put in the queue for the kiln.

It came out of the kiln with thin cracks where the flat back (handle) meets the
curved body (scoop). But it was very sturdy, and that was exciting. Then it was
time to glaze it. I don't remember what glaze I used. I was going for something
orange, but...

...it turned out brown. And it's great! The outside of the handle is unglazed,
and the glaze on the inside sealed the cracks that formed during bisque firing.
Overall, this one came out just about perfect.
