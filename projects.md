## Glazed

- dog food bowl

  A food bowl for my dog. Pretty simple hand-build with a paw print scraped into
  the center of the bowl. For glazing, I used "very white" for the inside and a
  black to fill in paw print. On the outside, I used "reitz blue" as a base,
  with streaks of "very white" (white), shaner red (hopefully turns brown at
  firing), and "iron saturate" (hopefully fires black) to maybe look like dog
  hair.

  | exterior base       | reitz blue                            | lightish blue                                                                                       |
  | exterior decoration | very white, shaner red, iron saturate | White, brown, and black, respectively. Meant to emulate strokes of dog fur. We'll see what happens! |

## Bisque fired

- coffee canister

  A canister for holding coffee. It has sculpted coffee beans stuck to the
  front, and a lid that fits into a lip on the top.

## Cleaned/trimmed

- soap dish, lidded box, cup with handle, planter

  These are all part of a hand-building class I took at home. They are with the
  studio to be glazed and fired, and I don't really know anything more about
  their status than that. They'll email me when they're ready to pick up.

## Constructed

- measuring scoop

  Take two of the 1/2-cup measuring cup. I've got the math right this time so...
  we'll see!

# Complete

- flour scoop

  Just a flour scoop. It has the word "flour" carved in cursive into the bottom
  of it. I don't remember what glaze I used, except that I was going for
  something kinda orange. It turned out brown.

- accidental shot glass

  This was supposed to be a 1/2-cup measuring cup for my dog's food. When I did
  my math, I used the radius when I meant to use the diameter, so it's only
  about a quarter the size it's supposed to be. Conveniently, it's just about
  right for a shot glass, so whatever! Glaze is all white.

# Thinking about

- lamp thing maybe?

  I'm kinda thinking a big vertical tube with room in the bottom to coil a rope
  light, and then holes carved into the tube to let light out. I would like to
  have a "floating" component as well.
