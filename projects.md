# In-progress

## Glazed

- soap dish, lidded box, cup with handle, planter

  These are all part of a hand-building class I took at home. They are glazed,
  fired, and ready for pickup. I haven't seen them yet.

## Bisque fired

- measuring scoop

  Take two of the 1/2-cup measuring cup. Holds precisely 1/2 cup!

## Cleaned/trimmed

# Complete

- coffee canister

  A canister for holding coffee. It has sculpted coffee beans stuck to the
  front, and a lid that fits into a lip on the top. It exceeded my expectations
  and I am beyond thrilled with how it turned out.

- dog food bowl

  A food bowl for my dog. Pretty simple hand-build with a paw print scraped into
  the center of the bowl. For glazing, I used "very white" for the inside and a
  black to fill in paw print. On the outside, I used "reitz blue" as a base,
  with streaks of "very white" (white), shaner red (hopefully turns brown at
  firing), and "iron saturate" (hopefully fires black) to maybe look like dog
  hair.

  **Lesson learned!** Don't sponge on glaze. It doesn't go on _nearly_ thick
  enough that way.

  | exterior decoration | very white, shaner red, iron saturate | White, brown, and black, respectively. Meant to emulate strokes of dog fur. We'll see what happens! | Washed out entirely |

  The glazing turned out pretty poorly. In an effort to have more control over
  the thickness of the glaze, I decided to try patting it on with a sponge. That
  resulted in too little glaze and several large spots inside the bowl that do
  not appear to be glazed at all. However, since it was fired to cone 10, the
  ceramic is vitrified, so this bowl is still food-safe, and frankly I kind of
  like the way it looks!
  
- flour scoop

  Just a flour scoop. It has the word "flour" carved in cursive into the bottom
  of it. I don't remember what glaze I used, except that I was going for
  something kinda orange. It turned out brown.

- accidental shot glass

  This was supposed to be a 1/2-cup measuring cup for my dog's food. When I did
  my math, I used the radius when I meant to use the diameter, so it's only
  about a quarter the size it's supposed to be. Conveniently, it's just about
  right for a shot glass, so whatever! Glaze is all white.

# Thinking about

- lamp thing maybe?

  I'm kinda thinking a big vertical tube with room in the bottom to coil a rope
  light, and then holes carved into the tube to let light out. I would like to
  have a "floating" component as well.
