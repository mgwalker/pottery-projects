## Glazed

- dog food bowl

  A food bowl for my dog. Pretty simple hand-build with a paw print scraped into
  the center of the bowl. For glazing, I used "very white" for the inside and a
  black to fill in paw print. On the outside, I used "reitz blue" as a base,
  with streaks of "very white" (white), shaner red (hopefully turns brown at
  firing), and "iron saturate" (hopefully fires black) to maybe look like dog
  hair.

  ### Glazing

  | paw print           | black                                 | black                                                                                               |
  | exterior base       | reitz blue                            | lightish blue                                                                                       |
  | exterior decoration | very white, shaner red, iron saturate | White, brown, and black, respectively. Meant to emulate strokes of dog fur. We'll see what happens! |

## Bisque fired

_(nothing currently)_

## Cleaned/trimmed

- coffee canister

  A canister for holding coffee. It has sculpted coffee beans stuck to the
  front, and a lid that fits into a lip on the top. This one is in the kiln now
  and hopefully it won't explode or crack, but I'm not super optimistic that the
  lid is going to survive unscathed.

- soap dish, lidded box, cup with handle, planter

  These are all part of a hand-building class I took at home. They are with the
  studio to be glazed and fired, and I don't really know anything more about
  their status than that. They'll email me when they're ready to pick up.

## Constructed

_(nothing currently)_

# Complete

- flour scoop

  Just a flour scoop. It has the word "flour" carved in cursive into the bottom
  of it. I don't remember what glaze I used, except that I was going for
  something kinda orange. It turned out brown.

- accidental shot glass

  This was supposed to be a 1/2-cup measuring cup for my dog's food. When I did
  my math, I used the radius when I meant to use the diameter, so it's only
  about a quarter the size it's supposed to be. Conveniently, it's just about
  right for a shot glass, so whatever! Glaze is all white.

# Thinking about

- measuring scoop

  Take two of the 1/2-cup measuring cup. I've got the math right this time so...
  we'll see!

- lamp thing maybe?

  I'm kinda thinking a big vertical tube with room in the bottom to coil a rope
  light, and then holes carved into the tube to let light out. I would like to
  have a "floating" component as well.
