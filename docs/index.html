        <p>
          A canister for holding coffee. It has sculpted coffee beans stuck to
          the front, and a lid that fits into a lip on the top. It exceeded my
          expectations and I am beyond thrilled with how it turned out.

        <p>dog food bowl</p>
        <p>
          A food bowl for my dog. Pretty simple hand-build with a paw print
          scraped into the center of the bowl. For glazing, I used &quot;very
          white&quot; for the inside and a black to fill in paw print. On the
          outside, I used &quot;reitz blue&quot; as a base, with streaks of
          &quot;very white&quot; (white), shaner red (hopefully turns brown at
          firing), and &quot;iron saturate&quot; (hopefully fires black) to
          maybe look like dog hair.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Lesson learned!</strong> Don't sponge on glaze. It doesn't go
          on <em>nearly</em> thick enough that way.

          The glazing turned out pretty poorly. In an effort to have more
          control over the thickness of the glaze, I decided to try patting it
          on with a sponge. That resulted in too little glaze and several large
          spots inside the bowl that do not appear to be glazed at all. However,
          since it was fired to cone 10, the ceramic is vitrified, so this bowl
          is still food-safe, and frankly I kind of like the way it looks!

        <p>flour scoop</p>
        <p>
          Just a flour scoop. It has the word &quot;flour&quot; carved in
          cursive into the bottom of it. I don't remember what glaze I used,
          except that I was going for something kinda orange. It turned out
          brown.

        <p>accidental shot glass</p>
        <p>
          This was supposed to be a 1/2-cup measuring cup for my dog's food.
          When I did my math, I used the radius when I meant to use the
          diameter, so it's only about a quarter the size it's supposed to be.
          Conveniently, it's just about right for a shot glass, so whatever!
          Glaze is all white.

        <p>lamp thing maybe?</p>
        <p>
          I'm kinda thinking a big vertical tube with room in the bottom to coil
          a rope light, and then holes carved into the tube to let light out. I
          would like to have a &quot;floating&quot; component as well.
