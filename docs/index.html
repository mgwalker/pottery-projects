    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>dog food bowl</p>
        <p>
          A food bowl for my dog. Pretty simple hand-build with a paw print
          scraped into the center of the bowl. For glazing, I used &quot;very
          white&quot; for the inside and a black to fill in paw print. On the
          outside, I used &quot;reitz blue&quot; as a base, with streaks of
          &quot;very white&quot; (white), shaner red (hopefully turns brown at
          firing), and &quot;iron saturate&quot; (hopefully fires black) to
          maybe look like dog hair.
        </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>coffee canister</p>
        <p>
          A canister for holding coffee. It has sculpted coffee beans stuck to
          the front, and a lid that fits into a lip on the top.
        </p>
      </li>

    <h2>Cleaned/trimmed</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>soap dish, lidded box, cup with handle, planter</p>
        <p>
          These are all part of a hand-building class I took at home. They are
          with the studio to be glazed and fired, and I don't really know
          anything more about their status than that. They'll email me when
          they're ready to pick up.

      <li>
        <p>measuring scoop</p>
        <p>
          Take two of the 1/2-cup measuring cup. I've got the math right this
          time so... we'll see!
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Complete</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>flour scoop</p>
        <p>
          Just a flour scoop. It has the word &quot;flour&quot; carved in
          cursive into the bottom of it. I don't remember what glaze I used,
          except that I was going for something kinda orange. It turned out
          brown.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>accidental shot glass</p>
        <p>
          This was supposed to be a 1/2-cup measuring cup for my dog's food.
          When I did my math, I used the radius when I meant to use the
          diameter, so it's only about a quarter the size it's supposed to be.
          Conveniently, it's just about right for a shot glass, so whatever!
          Glaze is all white.

    <h1>Thinking about</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>lamp thing maybe?</p>
        <p>
          I'm kinda thinking a big vertical tube with room in the bottom to coil
          a rope light, and then holes carved into the tube to let light out. I
          would like to have a &quot;floating&quot; component as well.
