              <h3>dog food bowl</h3>A food bowl for my dog. Pretty simple hand-build with a paw print scraped
into the center of the bowl. For glazing, I used &quot;very white&quot; for the
inside and a black to fill in paw print. On the outside, I used &quot;reitz
blue&quot; as a base, with streaks of &quot;very white&quot; (white), shaner red
(hopefully turns brown at firing), and &quot;iron saturate&quot; (hopefully fires
black) to maybe look like dog hair.

              <h3>coffee canister</h3>A canister for holding coffee. It has sculpted coffee beans stuck to the
front, and a lid that fits into a lip on the top. This one is in the kiln
now and hopefully it won&#39;t explode or crack, but I&#39;m not super optimistic
that the lid is going to survive unscathed.

              <h3>planter</h3>The soap dish, lidded box, cup with handle, and planter are all part of a
hand-building class I took at home. They are with the studio to be glazed
and fired, and I don&#39;t really know anything more about their status than
that. They&#39;ll email me when they&#39;re ready to pick up.

          <h3>flour scoop</h3>Just a flour scoop. It has the word &quot;flour&quot; carved in cursive into the
bottom of it. I don&#39;t remember what glaze I used, except that I was going
for something kinda orange. It turned out brown.

          <h3>accidental shot glass</h3>This was supposed to be a 1&#x2F;2-cup measuring cup for my dog&#39;s food. When I
did my math, I used the radius when I meant to use the diameter, so it&#39;s
only about a quarter the size it&#39;s supposed to be. Conveniently, it&#39;s
just about right for a shot glass, so whatever! Glaze is all white.

          <h3>measuring scoop</h3>Take two of the 1&#x2F;2-cup measuring cup. I&#39;ve got the math right this time
so... we&#39;ll see!

          <h3>lamp thing maybe?</h3>I&#39;m kinda thinking a big horizontal tube with room in the bottom to coil a
rope light, and then holes carved into the tube to let light out. I would
like to have a &quot;floating&quot; component as well.
