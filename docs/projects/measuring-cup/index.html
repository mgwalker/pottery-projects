    <h1>Accidental shot glass</h1>
     <p>This was supposed to be a 1/2-cup measuring cup for my dog's food. When I did my
math, I used the radius when I meant to use the diameter, so it's only about a
quarter the size it's supposed to be. Conveniently, it's just about right for a
shot glass, so whatever! Glaze is all white.</p>
